                    The Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence at Helwan University (formerly Computers and Information) is one of the colleges of Helwan University, located southwest of the university campus. It was established by a decision of the University Council on July 18, 1994 and with the approval of the Supreme Council of Universities in 1996 with the aim of contributing to community service and providing the opportunity to learn computer science and information systems. The study actually began at the college in 1996. Later in 2006, a software engineering program was added, and in 2019 a medical informatics program offered by the Department of Information Systems and two diploma and master's programsComputational Linguistics is provided by the Department of Computer Science, and a third department, Information Technology, has also been added. In April 2019, the Supreme Council of Universities issued a decision to change the name of the college from the College of Computing and Information to the College of Computing and Artificial Intelligence. The study in all departments of the college adopts the credit-hour system and lasts for four years.
