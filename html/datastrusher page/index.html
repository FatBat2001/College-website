                    <h2>what is data structure?</h2>
                    <p>A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure</p>
        
                    <h2>What is data structure explain types of data structure?</h2>
                    <p>A data structure is a collection of data type 'values' which are stored and organized in such a way that it allows for efficient access and modification. When we think of data structures, there are generally four forms: ... Linear: arrays, lists. Tree: binary, heaps, space partitioning etc</p>
              
                    <h2>What are basic data structures?</h2>
                    <p>Data structures are the implementations of abstract data types in a concrete and physical setting. They do this by using algorithms. This can be seen in the relationship between the list (abstract data type) and the linked list (data structure). A list contains a sequence of values or bits of information</p>

                    <h2>How is data structure used in real life?</h2>
                    <p>To implement printer spooler so that jobs can be printed in the order of their arrival. To implement back functionality in the internet browser. To store the possible moves in a chess game. To store a set of Ô¨Åxed key words which are referenced very frequently</p>

                    <ul>
                       <li>Data structures allow information storage on hard disks</li>
                       <li>provides means for management of large dataset such as databases or internet indexing services</li>
                       <li>Are necessary for design of efficient algorithms</li>
                       <li>allows safe storage of information on a computer</li>
                       <li>allows the data use and processing on a software system</li>
